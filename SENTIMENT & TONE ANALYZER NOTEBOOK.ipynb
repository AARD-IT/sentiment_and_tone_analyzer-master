    "\n",
    "Organizations receive large volumes of unstructured textual feedback through sources such as customer reviews, surveys, support tickets, social media comments, and internal communications. Manually understanding the emotional intent behind this feedback is time-consuming, subjective, and does not scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "Traditional keyword-based or rule-based sentiment analysis systems fail to capture:\n",
    "- Subtle emotional cues and mixed sentiments\n",
    "- Context-dependent tone such as urgency, formality, or dissatisfaction\n",
    "- Negative intent expressed without explicit negative keywords\n",
    "\n",
    "This project addresses these challenges by implementing a **Sentiment & Tone Analyzer powered by Large Language Models (LLMs)**. The system automatically classifies text into:\n",
    "- **Overall sentiment** (Positive, Negative, Neutral)\n",
    "- **Dominant tone** (e.g., Joyful, Angry, Formal, Urgent, Derogatory)\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution processes feedback in bulk, produces structured and explainable results, and is designed as a **standalone, production-ready analytics component** that can be integrated into customer experience platforms, CRM systems, and monitoring dashboards.\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging Gen AI with strict JSON output enforcement, the system ensures accuracy, consistency, and scalability for real-world sentiment intelligence use cases.\n",
